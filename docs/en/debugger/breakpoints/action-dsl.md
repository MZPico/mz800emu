# Breakpoint - action on trigger (Action mini-DSL)

A breakpoint action is a sequence of commands that runs when the BP
fires (= the `condition` returned true and the hit/skip counts have
elapsed). In the Edit BP dialog the action is selected by the Mode
radio button:

| Mode | Effect | Action string |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Stop | Classic BP - stops the emulator | (empty action, NULL) |
| Log only | Prints to TTY and continues | `log "BP <name>"` |
| Custom | Full mini-DSL script | the user's text |

This document describes the mini-DSL syntax for Custom mode in the
breakpoint system.

## "Stop vs continue" semantics

The action mini-DSL has no explicit `stop` command. The decision to
halt the emulator is driven solely by whether the action string is
empty:

- **action == NULL or whitespace-only** -> the emulator stops
  (= classic BP stop).
- **action with any non-empty content** -> after evaluating all the
  commands the emulator continues (= implicit continue).

Consequence: if you want a BP that logs and then stops, it is **not
possible** to express that directly (it would require `stop`). The
workaround for stop-on-N is incrementing `$hits` plus an external Stop
BP, or Stop mode without a Custom script.

## Basic rules

- Commands are separated by a semicolon `;` or a newline.
- A comment starts at `#` and runs to the end of the physical line.
  A `#` inside `"..."` is not treated as a comment.
- Whitespace (outside strings) is ignored.
- Identifiers are case-insensitive (= consistent with the expression
  evaluator).
- Expression-type arguments are parsed by the same grammar as the
  condition - see `expression-syntax.md`.
- The parser is strict: an unknown command, wrong arity or an
  unterminated string literal = error; a BP with an unparsable action
  shows an inline error in the UI below the textbox, and the runtime
  behaves as an empty action (= stop fallback).

## Commands

The action mini-DSL provides 19 commands: 11 basic ones (log, continue,
disable_self, enable, disable, poke, set, mark, `$name` assignment,
clear_vars, if) and 8 forward commands for recording control (cdl_start,
cdl_stop, cdl_reset, cdl_export, trace_start, trace_stop, trace_save,
snapshot - see the "Forward commands" section below).

### `log "fmt"[, expr...]`

Prints a formatted message to stdout (`[BP-LOG] ...\n`). The format
string is the first argument, a string literal in double quotes with
escape sequences `\n`, `\t`, `\"`, `\\`.

| Spec | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `%X` | hex uppercase (`%04X` etc. **NOT supported** - only plain `%X`) |
| `%x` | hex lowercase |
| `%d` | signed decimal |
| `%u` | unsigned decimal (32-bit) |
| `%b` | binary (= no leading zeros, "0" for zero) |
| `%c` | character (low byte of the value as ASCII) |
| `%s` | arg = expression (address); lookup in sym_db, prints the symbol `name` or the placeholder `<no-symbol-at-0xADDR>` |
| `%%` | literal `%` |

Important: format width / padding (`%04X`, `%8d`) is **not supported**
by the parser - the spec is always a single character. If you want
zero-padded hex, create a fixed-width output externally (or use
multiple `log` calls).

Maximum of 8 arguments.

```
log "PC=%X A=%X HL=%X", PC, A, HL
log "frame=%d cycle=%d", Frame, Cycle
log "flags: C=%d Z=%d S=%d", Cf, Zf, Sf
log "JP target=%X (%s)", HL, HL          # %s lookup in sym_db
log "ret to %X (%s)", {SP}, {SP}         # %s with a 16-bit memory deref
```

Semantics of `%s`:

- arg is evaluated as a 16-bit address (low 16 bits, the rest is ignored)
- lookup in the global symbols ("CPU view", see `../symbols.md`)
- if a symbol is found, prints its `name` (= identifier from
  .lbl/.map/.noi/.sym)
- if not found, prints the placeholder `<no-symbol-at-0xADDR>` (4 hex
  digits)

A bank-specific lookup is not exposed in the action DSL.

The output goes to stdout.

### `continue`

A no-side-effect marker. The default is already continue (see the
"Stop vs continue semantics" above), so `continue` only serves as
readable self-documentation for the script reader.

```
continue
```

### `disable_self`

Disables the BP that triggered the action (= one-shot pattern).

If the action is being evaluated outside of enforcement (= Test Eval,
manual trigger), the command prints a warning to stderr and is a no-op.

```
disable_self
```

### `enable <name>`

Activates the BP with the given name (= sets `enabled = true`). The
name is searched case-sensitively by linear scan over the breakpoint
`name`.

```
enable trace_isr
```

If the BP does not exist, the command prints a warning to stderr and
is a no-op. The argument is not quoted - the name is taken as the rest
of the line after the keyword + whitespace.

### `disable <name>`

Deactivates the BP with the given name (= `enabled = false`). Same
lookup semantics as `enable`.

```
disable trace_isr
```

The argument is mandatory; without it the parser reports the error
"disable: missing target name".

### `poke <addr> <value>`

Writes 1 byte into memory. Both arguments are expressions separated by
whitespace (= not by a comma). The split finds the first whitespace
outside parentheses / brackets / strings.

```
poke 0x8000 0x42
poke HL A
poke 0xE000 + Y A & 0x0F
```

`value` is masked to the low byte (`& 0xFF`); `addr` to 16 bits.

### `set <reg> <value>`

Writes a value into a Z80 register. `reg` is an identifier (alpha +
digits + `_`), case-insensitive. `value` is an expression.

Supported registers:

- 8-bit: `A`, `F`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `H`, `L`
- 16-bit: `AF`, `BC`, `DE`, `HL`, `IX`, `IY`, `SP`, `PC`
- 8-bit halves of index registers: `IXH`, `IXL`, `IYH`, `IYL`
- shadow pairs (16-bit): `AF'`, `BC'`, `DE'`, `HL'`
  (the apostrophe is part of the name; the parser allows it at the
  end of an identifier)
- special: `I`, `R`, `IM` (`& 3`), `IFF1` (`& 1`), `IFF2` (`& 1`)

```
set A 0x42
set HL 0x8000
set PC 0x100  # forced jump
set IFF1 1    # enable interrupts
set BC' 0x1234  # write into shadow BC'
set IXH 0xFF  # high byte of IX, low byte preserved
```

Outside of enforcement (without a CPU context) it prints a warning and
is a no-op.

### `mark "name"`

Marker into trace-suite + optional stdout printout. `name` is a string
literal in double quotes with escape sequences (like the `log` fmt).

```
mark "ISR enter"
mark "frame boundary"
```

**Two-branch behavior:**

When a BP with the `mark "name"` action fires, **each of the following
branches runs independently** according to configuration:

1. **Marklog binary record** - if `[TRACE_MARKLOG] mode` is
   `WITH_WINDOW` or `ALWAYS` (and the writer is active), a 24 B record
   is written into `<dir>/<name>.NNN.bin` with a pre-resolved
   `marker_id`. The id -> name mapping is in `meta.json`.
2. **Stdout printout** `[BP-MARK] <name>` - if
   `[TRACE_MARKLOG].stdout_enabled` is `1` (default).

Default behavior without configuration = stdout only.

**Marker name limits:**

- Max 63 chars (+ NUL terminator = 64 B). Longer ones are truncated at
  parse time + a stderr warning.
- Max 65535 unique markers per session. Overflow = stderr warning, the
  marklog branch is a no-op for that BP action (stdout still works if
  cfg ON).

**Format details:** `docs/en/debugger/formats/MARK-log_format.md`

The marker ID is registered during BP parse. The hot-path fire then
calls no string operations - it writes a 24 B record from the
pre-resolved id.

### `$name = <expr>`, `$name <op>= <expr>`

Assignment to a user variable. `$name` is an identifier validated by
the regex `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$` (= first character alpha or `_`,
continuation alpha / digits / `_`), max 31 characters. No reserved
keywords (= the `$` prefix is itself distinctive). Variable lifetime
is per-emulator-session; they are shared across all BPs and persist
into the `.bpt` JSON `vars` section plus a per-arch standalone
`.vars` file. Detail in `vars.md`.

Operators:

| Op | Semantics |
|----|-----------|
| `=` | plain assignment |
| `+=` | `cur + rhs` |
| `-=` | `cur - rhs` |
| `*=` | `cur * rhs` |
| `/=` | `cur / rhs` (division by zero -> 0) |
| `<<=` | shift left (rhs masked to 5 bits) |
| `>>=` | shift right |
| `&=` | bitwise AND |
| `\|=` | bitwise OR |
| `^=` | bitwise XOR |

If `$name` does not yet exist, the current value is 0 (= consistent
with the read-side default). A compound operator then works with 0 as
the left-hand side.

```
$hits += 1
$mask = 0xFF
$last_pc = PC
$accumulator |= 1 << bit_pos
```

A single `=` is rejected by the evaluator (= the condition expression
has no assignment); in the action DSL, on the contrary, assignment is
the only valid meaning.

### `clear_vars`

Clears the values of all existing `$name` variables (the entries
**remain** in storage; comment + persist_value flag are preserved).
Semantics "state machine reset" - the UI panel then sees the same
identifiers with value 0.

This is not the same as deleting the entries - to fully remove a
variable use the `x` button in the table row or the bulk "Delete"
button + selection.

```
clear_vars
```

### `if <expr> then <stmt> [else <stmt>]`

A single-line conditional. After evaluating `expr` (= an expression
per `expression-syntax.md`), if it is non-zero the `<stmt>` in the
then-body runs. If it is zero and an `else` branch is present, the
`<stmt>` in the else-body runs.

`else` is optional. There is no multi-statement block, no nested
`if/then/if/then` block (the parser does not technically forbid it,
but it is not tested).

For a multi-statement body use several separate `if`s with the same
condition, or a `$flag` variable:

```
if A == 0x42 then log "match A=0x42"
if A == 0x42 then $matched = 1
```

The keywords `then` and `else` must be whole words (= surrounded by
whitespace or at the end of the string), at the top-level depth (= not
inside `()` / `[]` / `{}` / a string).

```
if PC >= 0x1000 && PC < 0x2000 then log "in code seg PC=%X", PC
if $hits >= 5 then disable_self
if HL == 0 then mark "HL underflow"
if A == 0 then log "zero" else log "nonzero=%X", A
if $state == 1 then enable trace_bp else disable trace_bp
```

## Forward commands (recording control from a BP)

Forward commands let a breakpoint action run recording operations
automatically when the BP fires - the same effect as the corresponding
MCP / GUI call, but without manual intervention. The goal: a single
well-placed breakpoint instead of dozens of manual commands. On a hit
they run synchronously.

### `cdl_start`, `cdl_stop`, `cdl_reset`

Code/Data Logger (Memory Heatmap) lifecycle. No arguments. `cdl_start`
turns recording on, `cdl_stop` turns it off, `cdl_reset` zeroes the
counters.

```
cdl_start
cdl_reset
```

### `cdl_export "fmt"[, args...]`

Export the CDL data to a file. `fmt` is a file-name template with the
same specifiers and arguments as `log` (= `%X`, `%d`, `$variables`,
...).

```
cdl_export "cdl-dump.json"
cdl_export "cdl-%d.json", $id
```

### `trace_start <channel>`, `trace_stop <channel>`

Start / stop a binary trace-suite channel. `<channel>` is one of
`cputrack` / `iorqlog` / `intlog` / `hwlog` (case-sensitive, no quotes).

```
trace_start cputrack
trace_stop cputrack
```

### `trace_save <channel>, "fmt"[, args...]`

Save / redirect a trace channel segment. The channel name is followed
by a comma and a file-name template (same as the `log` fmt + args).

```
trace_save cputrack, "seg-%d.bin", $id
```

### `snapshot "fmt"[, args...]`

Save a .mzs snapshot. `fmt` is a file-name template (like the `log` fmt
+ args). Works from a continuing BP too (non-empty action = continue): the
action runs on the emulator thread between instructions (a safe-point), so
the snapshot is saved without manually pausing the emulator. This lets a
single continuing BP capture both a trace segment and a snapshot.

```
snapshot "snap.mzs"
snapshot "snap-%d.mzs", $id
```

All file-name templates (`cdl_export` / `trace_save` / `snapshot`)
share the same renderer as `log`, so you can generate numbered files
with `$variables`, e.g.:

```
snapshot "snap-%d.mzs", $id
$id += 1
```

For the MCP equivalents see the
[MCP tools overview](../../mcp-server/tools-overview.md); for trace
channel configuration see [Trace Suite](../Trace_Suite.md).

### Flood protection (rate limit + saturation)

Heavy forward actions (`snapshot`, `trace_save`) write to disk. To
keep a breakpoint that fires very frequently from flooding the
emulator or the disk, they have built-in protection:

- **Rate limit.** A minimum delay applies between two heavy actions of
  the same BP; firing faster is silently skipped. Optionally a hard
  cap on the number of saves per session can be set - once reached the
  BP disables itself. These limits are settable per BP (via MCP / GUI);
  otherwise the global default from configuration applies.
- **Byte saturation.** When the cumulative volume written by forward
  actions exceeds the threshold the emulator auto-pauses and emits a
  warning with a reason.
- Even when a continuing BP triggers a heavy action, pause / stop /
  clear-breakpoint commands always take effect - the emulator does not
  get stuck.

## Full examples

### Trace without stopping (= classic Log only equivalent)

```
log "PC=%X HL=%X A=%X", PC, HL, A
```

### Hit counter with one-shot disable

```
$hits += 1
log "hit #%d at PC=%X", $hits, PC
if $hits >= 5 then disable_self
```

### Conditional poke (= patch ROM call result)

```
if A == 0xFF then poke HL 0x00
if A == 0xFF then log "patched HL=%X", HL
```

### Cross-BP enable / disable (= state machine)

BP "isr_enter":
```
enable isr_trace
mark "ISR enter"
```

BP "isr_exit":
```
disable isr_trace
mark "ISR exit"
```

BP "isr_trace" (initially disabled):
```
log "ISR step PC=%X", PC
```

### Forced jump after N repetitions

```
$count += 1
if $count >= 100 then set PC 0x8000
if $count >= 100 then $count = 0
```

## Error states

### Parse-time

A lexer / parser error (bad keyword, unterminated string, bad `set` /
`poke` syntax, missing `then`, ...) is shown as an inline error below
the action textbox in the Edit BP dialog. The BP runtime behaves as
an empty action (= Stop fallback - the emulator stops) until you fix
the error.

### Runtime

Most runtime errors are tolerant with a stderr warning:

- `enable` / `disable` with a non-existent target -> warning, no-op.
- `set` with an unknown register -> warning, no-op.
- `set` without a CPU context -> warning, no-op.
- `disable_self` outside enforcement (= Test Eval) -> warning, no-op.
- `poke` outside addressable RAM (= banking) -> typically a no-op or a
  write into the bank-aliased area, depending on the memory subsystem
  behavior.

`/` and `%` in $var compound and in expr arguments: division by zero
-> 0.
